# lamiya_chat_socket
This is a simple group chat app. You can connect with your friends and family via this app. Here I have used www.socket.io to develop this app. Also for server side I have used node and express.js.

### Installation

I am using ubuntu 16.04. Put this app on Desktop.

$ cd 

$ cd Desktop

$ cd lamiya_chat_socket

$ sudo apt install aptitude

$ sudo aptitude install npm

$ npm install --save

$ npm install --save express@4.15.2

$ node index.js

This app will run on 4000 port. We need two browser to test this app on localhost.

On firefox visit http://localhost:4000 and also on chrome visit the same address.

Write "abc 1" on firefox. You can see this message on chrome. Also from chrome write "abc 2". You can see same message on firefox.
